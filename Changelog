ProBIND 1.0.3 (10 November 2008)
--------------------------------

It's been some time since the last release, and I was hoping to have more
done. Unfortunately, some big projects came up, and re-working things like the
import system will take some time, so it's best to make a release with 
bugfixes completed.

- Bug 1885891 - Deletion of zone broken
- Bug 1981649 - Add updated root.hints
- Bug 1928820 - Clarify reverse zone population in documentation
- Clean code to load config.php in lib.inc
- Clean code to load libraries in import script
- Remove broken "help" links that go to manual.html


ProBIND 1.0.2 (25 December 2007)
--------------------------------

After a long hiatus, the ProBIND project is alive again! Welcome to those
updating to this release and to those new to the software. This release
incorporates the work done in the ProBIND2 fork (now defunct) and involves
cleanup work to allow ProBIND to function on modern configurations. There is
otherwise no major functionality changes in this release. Please look over the
TODO file for future plans.

- Merged in changes from ProBIND2.
- Cleaned up unused files from merge.
- Removal of ProBIND2 namespace system.
- Removed forced auth on update - webserver should be configured to
  handle, not us.
- Changed default remote user to root in the push scripts.
- Miscelaneous cleanup involving replacing short open tags with full tags
  and clean up uninitialized variables.
- Updates to INSTALL, README, TODO files
- Added upgrade instructions in UPGRADE
