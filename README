Installation
------------

Please see INSTALL for instructions


What is ProBIND?
----------------

ProBIND is a web application intended for use in the administration of one or
more servers running ISC BIND.

ProBIND is written in the PHP scripting language and uses MySQL to store its
data. The contents of the database are generated into files formatted for ISC
BIND and are pushed to the controlled servers on request through the interface
or by a scheduled job.


Advantages of ProBIND
---------------------

- ProBIND allows for quick searching across domains, allowing for quick editing
  of important information.
  
- ProBIND has built-in templating to allow the use of certain standard
  information across all zones.
  
- Based on settings in ProBIND, NS records will be automatically created.

- ProBIND can automatically populate reverse zones (in-addr.arpa) for all your
  A records. All you need to do is add the zone.


Security Notice
---------------

Because of the high level of access that is currently needed for the operation
of this application, it is highly recommended that you run ProBIND on a non-
public web server. It is further recommended that you set your web server to
use authentication for access to the application. 


Limitations
-----------

- The import script is rather limited and doesn't work well with extended
  features (GENERATE is an example) or odd formatting.

- The import script cannot handle zone files larger than 64 kilobytes

- Currently, a server can be only a master or a slave. Mixing of roles is not
  possible.
  
- ProBIND can only automatically handle in-addr.arpa zones for /24 networks.
  Other sizes can only be handled manually at this time. 

- Only a subset of all possible record types is supported. These include A, CNAME,
  MX, NS, PTR, TXT, and HINFO.

- ProBIND exists independently of ISC BIND, thus no feedback from BIND itself
  is used. This may change in the future, although it will be limited due to
  the nature of ProBIND.

I would like to acknowledge PhD Computing for offering support and time to
contribute to this project and get it started again.


ProBIND 2 Maintainer: Alexei P. Roudnev


Original Author: Flemming S. Johansen <fjohansen@proventum.net>

I acknowledge the role of my colleague Lasse L. Johnsen, who has
contributed a lot of useful suggestions, without which this software
would almost certainly be utterly useless to anyone other than myself.

History
--------------------

ProBIND was originally developed by Flemming S. Johansen as part of his duties
as resident DNS manager at Proventum Solutions (now Consendo Systems A/S).

Later, a fork of ProBIND called ProBIND2 was developed by Alexei P. Roudnev, a
senior network/software engineer, at Exigen Group LTD.

ProBIND2 was re-incorporated in ProBIND by the new maintainer, Michael Johnson,
a systems administrator for PhD Computing,
